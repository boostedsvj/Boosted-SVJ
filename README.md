# Boosted-SVJ

## Timeline

This is a tentative plan towards publication of the boosted SVJ analysis. It somewhat assumes we do not encounter show-stoppers that require a very in-depth study, and could therefore be considered optimistic.

Date of last revision: July 23 2020

- **July 2020:** First contact with EXO conveners
- **September 2020:** First presentation of analysis in EXO general meeting.
  - Target: Semi-finalized trigger studies and preselection
  - Nice-to-have: A preliminary guesstimate of sensitivity of the analysis
- **December 2020:** 'Tracer bullet' of the analysis
  - Target: Pretty good idea of the fit strategy
  - Target: An end-to-end analysis chain all the way up to limit plots. Intermediate parts may be unfinished (e.g. a fully characterized tagger may still be in the works, and a study of the systematics may still be underway). Limit plots should be a reasonable estimate at this point.
  - Target: AN should be reasonably complete, first steps towards paper draft should be made
  - Nice-to-have (any of the following): Fully studied tagger, fully understood systematics, fully understood background fit
- **February 2020:** Pre-approval
  - Target: Finalized fit strategy, tagger
  - Target: Paper draft in good shape
- **March/April 2020:** Approval, followed by CWR
  - Depending on timeline, turn paper draft into a PAS in case we're targetting a conference at this point and publication is not close enough
- **May/June 2020:** Publication
